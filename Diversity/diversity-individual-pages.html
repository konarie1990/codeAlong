           <h2>What it means to me:</h2>
           <p style="color: rgb(160, 53, 53); text-align: center;">"I'm a white American woman of northern European descent, and I know I've benefited from my whiteness and from the legacy of racial and cultural discremination in this country. Still, I'm committed to promoting racial and cultural equality, because I firmly believe it's in the best interest of us all—and research backs me up.
           Even though my background is a priviledged one, promoting social equality is especially important to me as the mother of multicultural kids. I want my kids to be proud of their mixed heritage, to recognize the gifts that come with it, and for society to value those gifts too." -Lynn</p>
           <h2>The problem in a nutshell:</h2>
           <ul class="bodylist">
               <li>According to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">McKinsey study</a>, “Companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.”</li>
               <li>According to <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/07/fortune-500-diversity/">Fortune</a>, “Out of [the 2017] Fortune 500 list, 400 companies share no data about the gender or ethnicity of their employees.”</li>
               <li>According to <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/1-demographic-trends-and-economic-well-being/">Pew Social Trends</a>, the wealth gap between black and white households has actually increased since 1983, so that now households headed by a college-educated white person are 11 times wealthier than households headed by a college-educated black person. This means: There are differences in wealth, even when factoring for differences in education.</li>
               <li>According to the same report, the wealth gap between white and Hispanic households has consistently been wide. “In 2013, the net worth of white households was roughly 10 times that of households headed by a Hispanic.”</li>
            </ul>

           <h2>What to do about it:</h2>
           Diversity training has exploded over the past decade, but by some measures it has made the problem of inclusion even worse. There is increasing evidence that the better way to promote all types of diversity in the workplace is by <strong>advocating quantitative hiring and promotion policies and by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/how-the-government-mostly-closed-its-gender-pay-gap/506084/">eliminating as many opportunities as possible</a> for human discretion and therefore bias</strong>.
