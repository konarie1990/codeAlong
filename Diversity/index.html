            <h2>Race & Multiculturalism</h2>
            <h4 class="lynn"><a name="lynnsection">Lynn Wise</a></h4>
            <h3>What it means to me:</h3>
              <p>"I'm a white American woman of northern European descent, and I know I've benefited from my whiteness and from the legacy of racial and cultural discremination in this country. Still, I'm committed to promoting racial and cultural equality, because I firmly believe it's in the best interest of us all—and research backs me up.
              Even though my background is a priviledged one, promoting social equality is especially important to me as the mother of multicultural kids. I want my kids to be proud of their mixed heritage, to recognize the gifts that come with it, and for society to value those gifts too." -Lynn</p>
          <h3>The problem in a nutshell:</h3>
            <ul class="bodylist">
              <li>According to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">McKinsey study</a>, “Companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.”</li>
              <li>According to <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/07/fortune-500-diversity/">Fortune</a>, “Out of [the 2017] Fortune 500 list, 400 companies share no data about the gender or ethnicity of their employees.”</li>
              <li>According to <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/1-demographic-trends-and-economic-well-being/">Pew Social Trends</a>, the wealth gap between black and white households has actually increased since 1983, so that now households headed by a college-educated white person are 11 times wealthier than households headed by a college-educated black person. This means: There are differences in wealth, even when factoring for differences in education.</li>
              <li>According to the same report, the wealth gap between white and Hispanic households has consistently been wide. “In 2013, the net worth of white households was roughly 10 times that of households headed by a Hispanic.”</li>
             </ul>
            <h3>What to do about it:</h3>
              <p>Diversity training has exploded over the past decade, but by some measures it has made the problem of inclusion even worse. There is increasing evidence that the better way to promote all types of diversity in the workplace is by <strong>advocating quantitative hiring and promotion policies and by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/how-the-government-mostly-closed-its-gender-pay-gap/506084/">eliminating as many opportunities as possible</a> for human discretion and therefore bias</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Gender Diversity</h2>
        <h4 class="ron"><a name="ronsection">Ron Hajewski</a></h4>
        <h3>Impact on the world:</h3>
          <p>Back in 1843 Ada Lovelace, an English Mathematician and writer, worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine which is recoginized as the first "computing machine." Ada was the first person to recognize this machine had potential beyond pure calculations. She published the first algorithm for the machine and is considered the first computer programmer.</p>
      <h3>The problem in a nutshell:</h3>
        <ul class="bodylist">
          <li>Fast forward to 2018. Our society has reached a tipping point in which there is a massive dependency on software, and the need for more computer programmers is growing faster than any other industry. </li>
          <li>Why is it then, in 2018 - women make up less than 20% of U.S. tech jobs? Data shows there were 627,000 unfilled tech positions in April 2017. There are many reasons, some of which are lack of role models and mentors, sexism and unfair pay gap just to name a few. </li>
          <li>To drive the nail even further, a recent study that proves women may actually be better coders than men based on GitHub data has failed to receive it's much needed peer review by - you guessed it - a group of men. </li>
          <li>The scope of gender inequality and lack of diversity only widens when we address the transgender community. Transgender people have struggled to find a place in most studies and stastics on diversity in tech. Contributions from people like Brielle Harrison for her work at companies like Facebook, Netflix, Google and Apple go on to prove that gender diversity makes a long lasting and positive impact on the company's success.</li>
         </ul>
        <h3>What to do about it:</h3>
          <p>A recent study from The Peterson Institute for International Economics and EY shows that an organization with 30 percent female leaders adds up to 6 percentage points to its net margin. So more gender diversity equals a more innovative and profitable company? Yes. Making training accessible in specialized skills and recognizing the power diversity brings to your organization will give you a competitive edge. It doesn’t just benefit your company and its stakeholders—it benefits the world we live in as well.</p>

        <h2>LGBTQ Diversity</h2>
        <h4 class="alex"><a name="alexsection">Alex Dunagin</a></h4>
        <h3>Impact on the world:</h3>
          <p>Diversity and acceptance at work is good for employee morale and the bottom line. LGBTQ supportive policies and work place environments are linked to less discrimination. Less discrimination and more openness is linked to greater job commitment, improved workplace relationships, increased job satisfaction, improved health outcomes, and increased productivity among LGBTQ employees.</p>
      <h3>The problem in a nutshell:</h3>
        <ul class="bodylist">
          <li>Despite the progress made towards LGBTQ workplace equality, millions of Americans today go to work fearing losing their jobs because of who they are. </li>
          <li>The transgender unemployment rate is three times higher than the national average.</li>
          <li>Over one quarter (27%) of transgender people who held or applied for a job in the last year reported being fired, not hired, or denied a promotion due to their gender identity.</li>
          <li>Nearly one in ten LGBTQ employees have left a job because the environment was unwelcoming.</li>
          <li>Eight percent of LGBTQ employees report that discrimination negatively affected their work environment.</li>
          <li>No current federal law protects LGBTQ employees from discrimination. </li>
         </ul>
        <h3>What to do about it:</h3>
          <p>Today's workforce is increasingly diverse in terms of personal characteristics, and a well-managed diverse workforce will both reduce costs and generate greater profit. Business owners should take note, take action, and incorporate LGBTQ supportive workplace policies.</p>
